            John F. Kennedy was sworn into office as the 35th President on January 20, 1961. 
            One of his most critical accomplishments was successfully navigating the Cuban Missile Crisis, 
            which averted a potential nuclear war. He also established the Peace Corps, 
            inspiring a generation of Americans to service. Tragically, President Kennedy's term was cut short 
            when he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963.
