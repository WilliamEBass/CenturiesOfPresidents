            George Washington took office as the first President of the United States on April 30, 1789. 
            His most significant accomplishment was his leadership as the commander of the Continental Army, 
            leading the American colonies to victory in the Revolutionary War. 
            By serving just two terms, he also set the crucial precedent for the peaceful transfer of power. 
            Washington passed away on December 14, 1799, leaving a lasting legacy as the 'Father of His Country.
