            Barack Obama was sworn into office as the 44th President on January 20, 2009. 
            A landmark accomplishment of his presidency was the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 
            which significantly reformed the U.S. healthcare system to expand health insurance coverage. 
            After serving two full terms, he left office in 2017, and he continues to be an active public figure.
