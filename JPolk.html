            James K. Polk was inaugurated as the 11th President on March 4, 1845. 
            His presidency is most remembered for its vast territorial expansion of the United States, 
            driven by the belief in 'Manifest Destiny.' During his single term, 
            he oversaw the annexation of Texas and secured the Oregon Territory and the Mexican Cession, 
            which added over a million square miles to the nation. Polk died on June 15, 1849, 
            just a few months after leaving office.
